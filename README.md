# GetHome
You’re walking home. You notice something in the dark is following you. You decide you must stay in the light of the street near the sidewalks to get home as quickly and safely as possible. 
•	2.5D camera angle
•	Emphasis on mood setting through art style and music
Mechanics:
-	Obstacles in the street or along the sidewalk on your path
-	Interactive obstacles (example: magical flying trash can lids aimed at the player can be caught and flung at the thing following them)
-	Item stores: every so blocks or streets, the player will have a store appear and they will be given the opportunity to buy items to make them journey back home quicker
-	Food to replenish health
-	When the player goes to save, their character will quickly (unrealistically) pitch a tent whilst the save screen is present.
-	You can choose to go into a building and work your way through the building to be rewarded with a waypoint or ammo, food, etc.
Story:
 	In the year 2033, the world has just survived nuclear fallout.  The United States of America has been brought together under the evil (insert bullshit villain name). Part of this guy’s evil plan has been to separate children from their parents to train them for conquering the remainder of the world through military force.
 	You are enlisted in a camp. Given a few items, you somehow (this will be specified later) escape and set out to figure out where your home is, and then get there in one piece.
